  <p><em>(side note: I&rsquo;m done learning Swift for now. I&rsquo;ll come back to it in the new year, perhaps. I was enjoying my C++ adventures in plugin programming [Juce] more anywho. Also like I have skiing to do?!)</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing Advent of Code! The goal is to do it all this year. A great chance to really brush up my Go - Exercism has been nice, but a little easy. The more the merrier though!</p>
<p>My GitHub repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/jmontroy90/aoc-2024-golang">https://github.com/jmontroy90/aoc-2024-golang</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be publishing notes under each day as a README, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be reposting here. The notes help me organize my thoughts and perhaps give other people some visibility into how I approached the solution. Today, two days:</p>
<h2 id="day-1-easy"><a href="https://github.com/jmontroy90/aoc-2024-golang/tree/main/day1">Day 1</a>: Easy!</h2>
<p>Overall, an easy start. I spent more time setting up the repo structure and the file loader than anything else. The problem itself was really straight-forward - sort and compare. The second part could be done with sorted lists, but making a map and looking up its counts reads cleaner to me.</p>
<h2 id="day-2-problems-should-be-composed"><a href="https://github.com/jmontroy90/aoc-2024-golang/tree/main/day2">Day 2: Problems should be composed.</a></h2>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s more like it! Part 1 was pretty easy, but part 2 messed with me. Here are some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to re-program part 2 from scratch by just taking out the element at the index it occurred. But this doesn&rsquo;t work, because you need to try taking out each of the three relevant elements - any one of their removals might pop things into working condition.</li>
<li>Good, clean code mean finding nice boundaries; here, the part 1 boundary clearly was testing each report. But I modified this boundary to return the trouble index, which is required for part 2 to be clean and useful itself. I tried to think of a way to compose the two requirements (just returning &ldquo;is report safe&rdquo; bool + returning where the problem was), but it wasn&rsquo;t obvious. The cheap-y way to do it is to just create a <code>SafeReportResult</code> struct and return all relevant data that way - pay me big bucks please!</li>
<li>Once I started using <code>IsReportSafe</code> directly, Part 2&rsquo;s problem become what it should be - problem index removal. Compose your problems!!</li>
<li>This whole thing was also a nice exercise in recalling slice behavior. I totally botched my first attempting at using <code>append</code> because appending to a slice modifies its backing array at the slice point indicated. Total nonsense result. Using <code>slices.Concat</code> was nicer, but does too much allocation. Using <code>copy</code> - a rarity for me! - on a preallocated slice was nice to just pop the elements into where they&rsquo;re needed.</li>
<li>I looked at other AOC2024 Go solutions to figure out whether I was undercounting or overcounting once my first attempt was wrong. To be precise, I ran my input through their programs and then figured out which reports we disagreed on. This was really useful to pop into my table tests and start to realize how I&rsquo;d misconceived the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this took me a little while longer than expected, but that&rsquo;s fair - we&rsquo;re getting back into it!</p>
