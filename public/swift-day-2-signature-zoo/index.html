  <p>I alluded last time to the density of keywords and language primitives in Swift being quite ample (reminds me of my experience learning Rust, and my [extensive] time with Scala). As I mess around with the vanilla tutorials above, I&rsquo;m diving into some definitions (cmd + Click in Xcode), which are quite illuminating. Let&rsquo;s take a few and talk about them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->View<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>:</strong> the very first protocol you encounter when working with SwiftUI:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through some of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>public</strong>: This is just <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/accesscontrol/">access control</a>; apparently there&rsquo;s also an <em>open</em> keyword, where the difference is that <em>open</em> classes can be subclassed and overridden from other modules, whereas <em>public</em> classes can&rsquo;t be. Protocols can&rsquo;t be open, since the whole point of a protocol is to be implemented (or &ldquo;protocol conformance&rdquo;, as seems to be the parlance).
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of access control stuff - for now, we just remember that <strong>modules</strong> are a single unit, and <strong>packages</strong> are a group of modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>associatedtype</strong>: this is <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics/">generics</a>, like in Scala or Golang, and is later referred to by the <em>Self.</em><a href="http://Self.Bo">Bo</a>dy type. This associated type is a placeholder, and must be specified by implementing types. The <em>Body</em> itself must conform to the <em>View</em> protocol, which seems recursive, but just means that some custom struct implementing a <em>View</em> can then have a body composed of other predefined views, like <em>Text</em> or whatever.
<ul>
<li>This is different than <strong>typealias</strong>, which is just a different name for a type, but has nothing to do with conforming a protocol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>@MainActor</strong>: this is an attribute, like <em>@ViewBuilder</em> and <em>@preconcurrency</em>. But things get weird for me here. Some of these seem purely informational, like <em>@preconcurrency</em> (see below). But some are loaded with methods themselves, like this and <em>@ViewBuilder</em>.
<ul>
<li>What it actually does is simpler, as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor">seen here</a> - it marks code to run on a singleton actor that&rsquo;s basically the main thread. Things like UI changes need to be run on the main thread, to avoid race conditions on crucial state updates.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s just not terribly clear to me yet the relationship between these different kinds of primitives in Swift. It&rsquo;s a lot of overhead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll get into <em>@ViewBuilder</em> below, but it&rsquo;s even more of a doozy.</li>
<li>The code in all of this is not terribly helpful to read, because so much of it is closed-source.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>ViewBuilder</em></strong>: the struct behind the <em>@ViewBuilder</em> _attribute:</p>
<p>Woof. This is even more furious. Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost - this is <strong>closed-source code</strong>! So the reason this looks like a protocol is because we can&rsquo;t see the actual code. Bummer.</li>
<li>This struct has <strong>two <em>extension</em> blocks</strong>. They have two different <em>@available</em> attributes annotated on them, e.g. they&rsquo;re available for different platforms. So that makes sense to me why they&rsquo;d be separate.
<ul>
<li>The argument I&rsquo;ve heard for totally different blocks despite no differences other than contained methods is just modularity / separation of concerns. That resonates okay with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>@resultBuilder</strong>: let&rsquo;s go through some questions.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What does this do?&rdquo; - well, apparently it enables DSLs like Views, e.g. most of the underpinnings of SwiftUI. You can plop things like <em>Text</em> and <em>Image</em> into an <em>HStack</em> without much fuss, and they compose (into a <em>TupleView</em> struct, apparently) just fine because of how the <em>@resultBuilder</em> maps elements to its methods above.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why is this lower-case?&rdquo; - well, it&rsquo;s closed-source, and not even the stubs are visible. That&rsquo;s probably why.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why use this?&rdquo; - I dunno, people like declarative DSLs that let them get up and running quickly? Frankly, I don&rsquo;t love the taste of this so far, especially as I read about implementing things like <em>buildEither</em> just to include if-statements in your closure. It&rsquo;s the curse of all DSLs - people demand more and more expressiveness (or developers get thirsty) until the differences between the DSL and the original language seem somewhat minimal to me. That&rsquo;s why I resonate with things like <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> over <a href="https://opentofu.org/">OpenTofu / HCL</a> - just use Golang, even if it&rsquo;s a bit kludgy. But then again, I&rsquo;m a Golang developer. But then again then again, I used Scala extensively for years and never enjoyed the DSL-y aspects of it (including SBT) - it just felt like learning a new, leaky-as-hell abstraction. Okay, I digress.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can I learn more concretely here, John?&rdquo; - sure, read some of the many articles dedicated to this. I make no promises of education here, lad.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift/5.4/result-builders">Hacking with Swift</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/result-builders/">SwiftLee</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/deep-dive-into-swift-function-builders/">Swift By Sundell</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>buildExpression<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(_ content: Content)</strong>: two notes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong> is just another generic. Fine. Apparently Swift allows predicates on generics, e.g. <strong>where Content : View</strong>, e.g. &ldquo;where our generic Content must fulfill the <strong>View</strong> protocol&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>(_ content: Content)</strong> is weird because it has two argument names, which is again our internal and external variable names. Here, **_ is just a placeholder, e.g. &ldquo;no external name required&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally&hellip;</p>
<p>WRAP THAT SIGNATURE</p>
<p>Jeesus! Okay, well, I found <a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/value-and-type-parameter-packs/">this SwiftLee article</a> helpful once again. Here&rsquo;s this in plain English, spoken from the perspective of the function:</p>
<ol>
<li>I, <strong>buildBlock</strong>, will accept many many different Content types.</li>
<li>However, they all must implement the <strong>View</strong> protocol.</li>
<li>But pass as many as you like! HStack, Text, Image, I don&rsquo;t care!</li>
</ol>
<p>This function is rather simple, but the language concepts embedded into it are pretty rich. It&rsquo;s also just keyword-heavy. But I <strong>think</strong> this is the way that things like <strong>HStack</strong> and <strong>VStack</strong> accept totally different things like <strong>Image</strong> and <strong>Text</strong>. They all have different types, but they&rsquo;re all implementing <strong>View</strong>, so we pass in a bunch and <strong>each</strong> one, <strong>repeat</strong>edly (<em>wink</em>) gets handled by <strong>buildBlock</strong>.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: Swift was designed by experienced developers who are NOT grouchy old-school devs like the developers of Golang.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d like these blogs to be at least slightly helpful, in addition to being my educational vehicle. So I think I&rsquo;ll just read all the comments and attributes and distill them into a little memory cheatsheet. Till then.</p>
