  <p>I will be leaving NYC on 5/1. This is sooner than expected, but probably for the best. My first destination will be Utah for a week of national parks, then SF to say hi to a friend, then Hawaii for waves, water, scuba, etc. This will probably take me to mid-June, and then we get going in earnest to Japan. After Japan, probably Vietnam or Thailand.</p>
<p>I just finished <a href="https://vagabonding.net/">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a> by Rolf Potts. This is the first travel book I&rsquo;ve read before my trip, and it feels like a good one to start with. It does have specific tips, yes, and the resource lists in the book and at <a href="https://vagabonding.net/resources/">vagabonding.net</a> are invaluable. But the book spends a lot more of its energy on overview, mindset, and attitude than anything else. And for this, I&rsquo;m already grateful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear to me after reading that I need to pair down my packing list and invest in some good travel gear. My laptop probably won&rsquo;t come for the ride, as much as it hurts me to spend this time without Ableton. Some goes for my Switch and Zelda - they&rsquo;ll be here when I get back. And to split my allegiance between staying present, grounded, curious, versus disappearing into the magical world of Hyrule&hellip;well, it kinda decides itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also gearing up for more flexibility in my scheduling. It seems like even accommodations can and maybe should be a bit impromptu. Probably the way to do it would be have set lodgings for a few days at my flight destination, whether it be Hanoi, Bangkok, wherever, and THEN explore day trips, surrounding towns, and smaller establishments local to the place to then book those. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m leveling up the &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; of my trip step by step on this front - taking the train all around Japan will be a good first stepping stone.</p>
<p>The book does a good job encouraging play, awareness, curiosity, kindness, humor, and open-mindedness. I&rsquo;ve never had a problem making friends when I solo travel, and this sojourn will be a good chance to more proactively seek out all kinds - ex-pats at hostels are great, but meeting locals is equally important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also clear to me that the roughly 7 months I&rsquo;ll be spending doing this will easily get gobbled up. The world is big, and I don&rsquo;t want to do the thing the book talks about where you sorta transiently pass through a place as a tourist, &ldquo;seeing Hanoi&rdquo; in a day or two before moving on. No, I&rsquo;ll be spending several weeks per place, which means my list of places will get smaller.</p>
<p>From here, it&rsquo;s a matter of knocking down basics - digital nomad insurance, immunizations, checking visas, and THEN just hitting up resources for each destination. Travel guides, reddit, expat forums, travel blogs, and so on. It&rsquo;ll be a lot of reading to do, but as long as I just take a bit every day, it&rsquo;ll be ok.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be aiming to get back to the States some time in January of 2024 - in time to hit ski season with some pals, so still vagabonding a bit, but very luxuriously.</p>
