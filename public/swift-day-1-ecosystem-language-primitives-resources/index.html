<title>Swift (Day 1)  - Ecosystem, Language Primitives, Resources | John Montroy</title>
<meta name="title" content="Swift (Day 1)  - Ecosystem, Language Primitives, Resources" />
<meta name="description" content="I wanna make an app. iOS for starters (it&rsquo;s what my friend and I have). Have several ideas, have friends with several ideas. Wanna blog about the process, so here we go.

Ecosystem: XCode &#43; Swift &#43; SwiftUI.

XCode is a nice IDE so far - a lot of shortcuts map over from my IntelliJ experience, and the auto-compiling preview functionality &#43; different compilation targets has been smooth and transparent.
I&rsquo;m not gonna mess with UIKit at all.
I&rsquo;m sad that Android uses Kotlin, I wanted to learn Kotlin. But both ecosystems are fairly locked, what with Android being a Kotlin &#43; Jetpack Compose world.
Cross-platform builds seem crippled by the usual suspects - lack of investment from the native platforms, complex access and abstraction to native primitives, native performance greatly exceeding cross-platform, etc. Options include Dart &#43; Flutter (also from Google), and Kotlin Multiplatform. For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to the native platforms.


Language Primitives: Swift has a lot of them! This is a really &ldquo;feature-rich&rdquo; language - I&rsquo;m gonna miss Go. Some ones that have stuck out:

Multiple initializers (designated, overloaded, convenience)
Extensions (like Scala&rsquo;s implicit classes, it seems)
Internal &#43; external function argument names (a new one for me, not sold yet)
Guard statements (safe unwrapping is nice)
Protocols (composable &#43; inheritable, embedded generics via associatedtype)
Structs AND classes (small differences)
Actors, async / await, queues too
Attributes galore (@MainActor, @inlinable, @preconcurrency, @frozen etc.)
So many ways to modify access, concurrency, optimizations via properties / access control (things like nonisolated, fileprivate, static, etc. &ndash; they all map to relatively sane, known concepts, but yeesh).


Learning: good resources so far.

ChatGPT-4o is my first line of inquiry for exploration. Super useful so far.
The Swift book seems well-done.
Apple has good resources including tutorials.

I&rsquo;ve started with the Develop with Swift tutorial - lots of basics, but well-done.
Swift Playgrounds are useful for a lot of sample apps.


The Exercism #48in24 challenges will be good for brushing up basics (with Golang too!).
I found some Swift repos I want to use as references, listed here.
This list of open-source iOS apps will be useful for perusal; filter for most stars with &ldquo;swiftui&rdquo; tag:



curl -o apps.json &#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/refs/heads/master/contents.json&#34;
jq &#39;.projects | map(select((.tags | index(&#34;swiftui&#34;)) and .stars != null)) | sort_by(-.stars)&#39; apps.json &gt; filtered_apps.json
Lots to learn and do! Let&rsquo;s see how this goes." />

  <p>I wanna make an app. iOS for starters (it&rsquo;s what my friend and I have). Have several ideas, have friends with several ideas. Wanna blog about the process, so here we go.</p>
