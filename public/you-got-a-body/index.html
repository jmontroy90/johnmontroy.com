  <p>My legs are strong. They always have been. I had good ups in basketball, was a natural hurdler and jumper, picked up skiing rapidly, drums pretty rapidly, and can pretty easily run for miles at a good pace without much worry.</p>
<p>My arms, not so much. They get stronger, but only through diligent, careful exercise.</p>
<p>Piano is a lot of arms, as you might notice! And so as I&rsquo;ve increased my piano-playing recently, my arms have had a bit of a rough go with it. The particular trigger was certainly my determination to get better at trilling - a pretty maximalist activity in terms of muscle engagement and tension.</p>
<p>So after basically not playing for all February because of travel and tension, here I am, on a mission to play more again, but without any nervies, shooties, whatever you wanna call the Bad Stuff that happens from over-use and tension.</p>
<p>That path is following a couple of concurrent paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>My body, my arms: this means learning basic anatomy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0DNfuNUE7o">Videos like this</a> are useful, but slightly overwhelming. All I&rsquo;ve learned so far, high-level, is that the forearm is like a Latin party. All the muscles have straight-forward names describing where they are, what they do, what they look like, and so on. I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with even the basics, like extension versus flexion, or brachii muscles, carpals, and so on.</li>
<li>Playing without tension: there are lots of videos dedicated to developing proper technique and avoiding anti-patterns, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMW6hBvZ2eo">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD9QcmlygKo">this one</a> from Dennis Zhdanov (whose technique series on Hanon and Brahms seem worth further perusal), and especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddh6NYb7M70">this one</a> from the excellent Nahre Sol. More on that later.</li>
<li>Exercises and stretching! Strengthening, stretching, and resting these muscles proactively matters a lot. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of wrist stretches, a lot of pressing on various flexor muscles in my forearm, and generally trying to stay very tethered to my physical muscles and how they feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting to kinda take inventory of the unit I&rsquo;ve been given as a human. Not until my 30s have I really done this, which makes sense &ndash; I&rsquo;m not as young as I used to be. My back is also a perpetual trouble spot for me, which means similar work needs to be done there.</p>
<p>I also just have this idea floating in my head of like, a tension budget. Typing on a computer, on my phone, playing piano, all make tiny withdrawals on my tension budget. Practicing trills is a night out in Vegas. And so much like real personal finance, staying cognizant of how you&rsquo;re working through your budget will help. I&rsquo;d like to practice piano <em>softer,</em> for one thing. I&rsquo;d like to not just use my right hand for phone stuff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not neglect one thing though - bodies are cool. I mean, it figures, all things are interesting if you look at them close enough. But bodies, just like brains, are just wild.</p>
