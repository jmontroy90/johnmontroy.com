  <p>New team, new language, new me. Security + Python. Learning Python is going well, although I don&rsquo;t really like the language for so many reasons. But feeling good.</p>
<p>Feeling wise &ndash; recent staff engineer, and armed with the tentative insight that what makes me a good engineer is the tendency to ask &ldquo;does this exist? do we need to write code for this?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Assigned a new task - an automation platform for cloud operations. Okay, let&rsquo;s do it. FastAPI, OpenAPI, automated tests, boom. Everything is FLOWING. My team seems delighted.</p>
<p>Now comes the useful part - the platform simply stitches together backend API calls and exposes those chained calls into a meaningful, easy-to-use API for users and other services.</p>
<p>I start looking through the docs for the backend API. There&rsquo;s auto-generated docs, sample JSONs, the usual mature stuff for this kind of backend. So I could copy these sample JSONs, read the docs, make some data classes, copy / paste some validations, write the methods, and off to the races.</p>
<p>But no. I&rsquo;m wiser than that - I&rsquo;m a <del>STAFF</del> engineer. Hell yea. There&rsquo;s gotta be some SDKs for this, right? Of course there are for this backend API. Java, C#, and ah, there it is, Python. Boom.</p>
<p>And this C# SDK, it look like it has auto-generated models! Of course it does, based on the docs I&rsquo;ve been looking at. Hey, there&rsquo;s a schema spec somewhere out here! It&rsquo;s used for auto-generating SDK types, and having meaningful, typed, validated types in your language of choice. It&rsquo;s probably used for serialization. Awesome.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s this?! The Python SDK doesn&rsquo;t have these types! And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s getting much love! Well, that&rsquo;s no good. I start to use it anyway, and think - I could write a simple client and provide these types. And I can even provide these types from the schema spec if I find it!</p>
<p>I do. I find it. It&rsquo;s a huge XML doc, but who cares, I only need my type, right? I do some parsing magic on my CLI, some little perl and awk one-liners, and I&rsquo;ve got what I need! Oh man. This is going awesome. I&rsquo;m a staff software engineer. Am I also&hellip;the best programmer ever? (Narrator: he wasn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Why stop there?! Let&rsquo;s fly closer to this burning sun of complexity! My one-liners turn into scripts to generate the Python code. It&rsquo;s standardized. I can do this for ANY type. Holy heck. I could just write this client?! What if I do this in Python? Can I open-source this client? Am I better at Python than I thought? Forget caution, I&rsquo;m in the ZONE. I&rsquo;m flowing.</p>
<p>I find XML parsing libraries. I parse the tree, extract out the type I want. I use Jinja2 for templating, and have a class definition. I tell some teammates that I&rsquo;ve got types for free. It&rsquo;s true. I do. My client delegates metadata on how to call a resource into the type itself, instead of just making massive client sets. Write the type, get all RESTful operations on that type for free. I really might be just, like, the best programmer ever, I think.</p>
<p>But of course, the attributes of my top-level class have types of their own, and if I work with the types, I can get really effective SerDe for initialization! Okay, so I need to parse the attribute types, find those in the schema spec, find if they have any new types themselves. Okay okay, this is getting hard - recursion always is - but I can do this. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with recursion since the Tower of Hanoi in 11th grade.</p>
<p>I write the code. It&rsquo;s long, it&rsquo;s messy. That&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;ll refactor it. I&rsquo;m a staff software engineer. I leave copious comments for future me, and even make the JIRA tickets. It&rsquo;s not a high priority. It may feel good, but I&rsquo;m a mature employee who knows when to stop.</p>
<p>And my code works! I&rsquo;ve recursively discovered and templated all subtypes for a single top-level type. I leave some things out though - the schema spec has these fields called Navigation Properties that seem unneeded and a little complex. I&rsquo;ll worry about it if I have to. I&rsquo;m a staff software engineer - I don&rsquo;t get carried away.</p>
<p>I generate my types. I use them in my API. They work. I write tests, I complete a ton of tickets. I worry about docs and security and usability and maintainability. I push left. I try to ignore the 400 lines of unmaintainable recursive garbage I just wrote to generate types. It&rsquo;s okay - it works, I won&rsquo;t need to revisit it for awhile, and I have comments and tickets and my mature wisdom on how to handle this. I am a STAFF. SOFTWARE. ENGINEER.</p>
<p>More user-facing APIs are implemented. I knock them down quick. I generate more types. Complexities start creeping in. Some types are nullable. The schema spec has inheritance baked in. I have to map from schema types to Python types. I have to deal with imports; snake casing vs. Pascal casing vs. camel casing; Jinja2 has some missingness trickiness I have to learn. That&rsquo;s okay. My time spent on the type generator is creeping up - a week of work hours at this point? But that&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s worth it. I&rsquo;m not getting carried away.</p>
<p>But I start to get worried. Doubt creeps in. This is so much more than I bargained for. Why didn&rsquo;t I expect this? Why didn&rsquo;t I email the owners of the back-end API immediately, ask them why their Python SDK is so weak? What did they find out that I don&rsquo;t know? How much more time am I going to lose to this?</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, I write up a beautiful email to the backend API owners. Ask them all the questions I should&rsquo;ve asked immediately. I don&rsquo;t get a response.</p>
<p>I refactor more code. I use best practices of refactoring. I create data structures with meaningful, small APIs in their method set (not that Python cares about exported vs. unexported). I roughly use patterns - mediators, creational patterns. I use Python things too - listcomps and class methods and some metaprogramming. The code slowly, brutally yields to the hours. I&rsquo;m still flowing, but it&rsquo;s got a different hue to it &ndash; rusted out, tired, unsure of the end goal.</p>
<p>Finally - I find a user-facing API that requires those Navigation Property fields I ignored either. Fine. I generate those types, it goes okay. I run my tests, and WHAM - unable to import from a partially initialized module. I look at the schema doc more closely - wait, these Navigation Property fields can contain themselves?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I wrack my brain. I look at the other SDKs - C# has namespaces, which allows for magical semi-global scope, beautifully circumventing the problem of a dependency graph. Not an option here, I don&rsquo;t think. I try anyway. A day passes. Two, three. I code 6-8 hours a day with diminishing returns each day. My sweatpants need washing. I keep eating lunch too late. It&rsquo;s fine I&rsquo;m a staff software engineer everything is fine.</p>
<p>I rewrite my generator code one last time. I don&rsquo;t need to generate all types, just the ones my top-level type requires. I laser-focus my recursion, make my exit condition a sort of quiescence of type discovery, a set stability. No imports means no loops, right?</p>
<p>But wait - anything in your <strong>init</strong> can reference other types in the same file with no dependency graph involved, because it&rsquo;s a method and isn&rsquo;t called on import. But not your parent types, for this weird inheritance.</p>
<p>Oh no no nooooooo.</p>
<p>I stare at my computer in sadness, contemplating my defeat. Total time spent is approaching three weeks. I have a working client, I do. But I had that a week ago, and I didn&rsquo;t think it was good then. I think it&rsquo;s worse now.</p>
<p>I fork off my git branch, push it up with a defeated commit message, making up a conventional commit tag of &ldquo;failed-wip&rdquo;. I revert numerous commits. I go back to last week. I follow up with the backend API team.</p>
<p>Never again. I got so excited, you guys. I thought I could do it, implement this beautiful Python client that worked off generated Python types.</p>
<p>I sure learned a lot technically, but more than anything else - I learned <strong>DON&rsquo;T do that.</strong> If a problem seems complex, it probably is. If an owning team hasn&rsquo;t solved it for you, there&rsquo;s probably a good reason for that. Find out that reason. Email the API owners. Follow up. Get your manager to yell at them. Do this all BEFORE you drop 2-3 weeks of difficult coding into the endeavor.</p>
<p>I tried to auto-generate a Python client, and all I got was this weird blog post. Sigh. Back to keeping it simple, stupid.</p>
