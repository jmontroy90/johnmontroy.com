<title>Digital Signal Processing: read-through | John Montroy</title>
<meta name="title" content="Digital Signal Processing: read-through" />
<meta name="description" content="A big goal of my 30s, intellectually / educationally speaking, is to finally marry my two great passions in life - music and technology. Despite the obvious synergies between the two, I&rsquo;ve never combined them much beyond a startling command of Finale during college, or passing interests in phenomena like beats and genres like spectralism. So it&rsquo;s high time we put them together and see what shakes out.
A lot of this effort will be in tools like Ableton and (hello again) Finale, as I try to write and compose. Some of it might be in AI, using LLMs trained for producing sounds (Mr. Bill has some real interesting examples of this). But academically, it&rsquo;s gonna be digital signal processing. And lucky me - there&rsquo;s a book online for just that! The Scientist and Engineer&rsquo;s Guide to Digital Signal Processing by Steven W. Smith - 600&#43; pages on all things DSP. I&rsquo;ve read a bit - it&rsquo;s technical, but not insanely so. And seems quite thorough; a whole chapter on linear systems is generous!" />

  <p>A big goal of my 30s, intellectually / educationally speaking, is to finally marry my two great passions in life - music and technology. Despite the obvious synergies between the two, I&rsquo;ve never combined them much beyond a startling command of Finale during college, or passing interests in phenomena like <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/Lesson-3/Interference-and-Beats">beats</a> and genres like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_music">spectralism</a>. So it&rsquo;s high time we put them together and see what shakes out.</p>
<p>A lot of this effort will be in tools like Ableton and (hello again) Finale, as I try to write and compose. Some of it might be in AI, using LLMs trained for producing sounds (Mr. Bill has some real interesting examples of this). But academically, it&rsquo;s gonna be digital signal processing. And lucky me - there&rsquo;s a book online for just that! <a href="https://www.dspguide.com/">The Scientist and Engineer&rsquo;s Guide to Digital Signal Processing by Steven W. Smith</a> - 600+ pages on all things DSP. I&rsquo;ve read a bit - it&rsquo;s technical, but not insanely so. And seems quite thorough; a whole chapter on linear systems is generous!</p>
<p>The book is broken into chapters, and each chapter is divided into sections. So! Here&rsquo;s the goal: <strong>one section a day</strong>. Some sections are very short - great, easy day. Some are incredibly dense and will need supplementary research, which is also great. I don&rsquo;t really want to go beyond 30 minutes per day, but I do always want it to involve a review of the prior day, and then notes for that day.</p>
<p>Some structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>One section per day</li>
<li>Output: notes, links, sources</li>
<li>Blog will include a link to the section read</li>
<li>Blog titles will be &ldquo;DSP-RT: Day #&rdquo; for &ldquo;Digital Signal Processing - Read-Through&rdquo;</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll be tagged and categorized appropriately.</li>
<li>No more than 30 minutes per day, if possible! One good pomo, ya know.</li>
</ul>
