      <title>Karōshi: overworking in Japan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed upon arriving in Tokyo, taking the train from the airport at 8:30AM on a Tuesday, was how exhausted everyone looked. Immediately, a younger girl was nearly falling asleep on my shoulder. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked it up - it&amp;rsquo;s well-known and well-studied, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be improving terribly quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;karōshi&amp;rdquo;, e.g. &amp;ldquo;death from overwork&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a problem in Japan since at least the 1970s. The government even has a way to qualify as karōshi: if a (likely young or otherwise healthy) person dies from cardiovascular disease (stroke, heart failure, etc.) or mental health (suicide, maybe alcoholism?), and had worked more than 80 hours of overtime in a month (approx. 4 extra hours a day), it&amp;rsquo;s karōshi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Packing For A Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m nomading. Packing is fun and interesting. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but here are some takes, mostly tepid in temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-level takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;choosing clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m optimizing by, in order:&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space + weight&lt;/em&gt; - you gotta lug it everywhere broh&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Function&lt;/em&gt; - you really don&amp;rsquo;t need more than one of anything, other than socks and underwear. I&amp;rsquo;m consistently gonna be in pretty warm climates, so for shirts, I need one hiking / adventure shirt (moisture-wicking, tough), one (MAYBE two) going-out shirts, and one junk shirt (night time in shared spaces, going shopping, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drying&lt;/em&gt; - you&amp;rsquo;re gonna wash stuff in sinks, bathtubs, plastic tubs, and so on, and you need that stuff to dry quickly! For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased some briefs that are good for this, because my normal sets of briefs are way damp for way long.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting cars&lt;/strong&gt; is seeming more necessary than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped, but it&amp;rsquo;s very freeing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some things I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially think to bring that are looking necessary:&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand sanitizer&lt;/em&gt; - joins the crew of sunscreen, bug spray, toiletries, first aid, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redoxx.com/flexo-line-travel-clothesline-10103/p&#34;&gt;Laundry line&lt;/a&gt; - washing things on the go is a must, and drying things is tricky in limited space. Having a laundry line to loop around a bedpost or something seems necessary. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this pans out - I&amp;rsquo;m a little concerned about how much space this&amp;rsquo;ll take, and maybe washing machines are gonna be much easier to come by than I expect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laundry detergent sheets&lt;/em&gt; - see above. I probably need travel soap.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick-drying briefs&lt;/em&gt; - normal cotton-based briefs are not your friend, drying-wise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DCMNKX1&#34;&gt;Collapsible Tub&lt;/a&gt; - again, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this pans out, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;ll be really handy to have your own tub to wash things in, especially in shared spaces like hostels. Commandeering a sink for 20 minutes to wash your briefs is not gonna make you friends.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;buy things locally&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ll need little things like shampoo, dish detergent, new beach t-shirts, and so on. Why lug my New Jersey t-shirt to Hanoi, instead of buying some local stuff?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating out at restaurants is expensive&lt;/strong&gt;, expectedly - I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get into the flow of supermarkets and shared cooking spaces. Gonna lean into that more.&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hate to say it, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://huel.com/&#34;&gt;Huel&lt;/a&gt; is looking pretty attractive right now. TSA lets powders through too. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll POC it in Hawaii.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As an early-30s man who&amp;rsquo;s lived with roommates and alone for long periods, i suspect I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be pretty disappointed with the &lt;strong&gt;cohabitation skills&lt;/strong&gt; of my future hostel / Airbnb friendos. I was a pretty meh roommate myself in my 20s, so it&amp;rsquo;s to be expected.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my stuff, brought to you by a motel floor in Panguitch, UT, where my stuff is covering a set of stains that was either wine or blood or both:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting to get going!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be leaving NYC on 5/1. This is sooner than expected, but probably for the best. My first destination will be Utah for a week of national parks, then SF to say hi to a friend, then Hawaii for waves, water, scuba, etc. This will probably take me to mid-June, and then we get going in earnest to Japan. After Japan, probably Vietnam or Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://vagabonding.net/&#34;&gt;Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel&lt;/a&gt; by Rolf Potts. This is the first travel book I&amp;rsquo;ve read before my trip, and it feels like a good one to start with. It does have specific tips, yes, and the resource lists in the book and at &lt;a href=&#34;https://vagabonding.net/resources/&#34;&gt;vagabonding.net&lt;/a&gt; are invaluable. But the book spends a lot more of its energy on overview, mindset, and attitude than anything else. And for this, I&amp;rsquo;m already grateful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gonna Get Gone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot happened late last year, professionally (layoffs) and personally (it&amp;rsquo;s, uh, complicated), and I found myself in need of a pretty hard reset around January. I spent two months doing some part time work, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling very good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m leaving NYC on June 1st to travel the world. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly where yet, but it&amp;rsquo;ll likely start with US national parks + car camping, and then Japan, to go island-hopping. After that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Maybe Vietnam or Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
