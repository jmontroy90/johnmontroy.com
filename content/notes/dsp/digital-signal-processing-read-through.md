A big goal of my 30s, intellectually / educationally speaking, is to finally marry my two great passions in life - music and technology. Despite the obvious synergies between the two, I've never combined them much beyond a startling command of Finale during college, or passing interests in phenomena like [beats](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/Lesson-3/Interference-and-Beats) and genres like [spectralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_music). So it's high time we put them together and see what shakes out.

A lot of this effort will be in tools like Ableton and (hello again) Finale, as I try to write and compose. Some of it might be in AI, using LLMs trained for producing sounds (Mr. Bill has some real interesting examples of this). But academically, it's gonna be digital signal processing. And lucky me - there's a book online for just that! [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing by Steven W. Smith](https://www.dspguide.com/) - 600+ pages on all things DSP. I've read a bit - it's technical, but not insanely so. And seems quite thorough; a whole chapter on linear systems is generous!

The book is broken into chapters, and each chapter is divided into sections. So! Here's the goal: **one section a day**. Some sections are very short - great, easy day. Some are incredibly dense and will need supplementary research, which is also great. I don't really want to go beyond 30 minutes per day, but I do always want it to involve a review of the prior day, and then notes for that day.

Some structure:

- One section per day
- Output: notes, links, sources
- Blog will include a link to the section read
- Blog titles will be "DSP-RT: Day #" for "Digital Signal Processing - Read-Through"
- They'll be tagged and categorized appropriately.
- No more than 30 minutes per day, if possible! One good pomo, ya know.
